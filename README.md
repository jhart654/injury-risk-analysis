# Injury Risk Analysis Using Training and Recovery Data

## Overview
This project explores athlete injury risk using demographic, training, recovery, and injury history data. The goal is to identify patterns associated with injury likelihood and highlight insights relevant to injury prevention and performance management.

## Dataset
The dataset includes 1,000 athlete records with the following key variables:
- Player age, height, and weight
- Training intensity
- Recovery time
- Previous injury history
- Injury outcome indicator

## Analysis Approach
The analysis focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations to examine how injury likelihood varies across different athlete characteristics and workload-related factors.

Key areas explored include:
- Injury likelihood by age
- Training intensity differences between injured and non-injured athletes
- Recovery time distributions
- The relationship between previous injuries and future injury risk

## Key Insights
- Injury risk increases into the late 20s, with higher observed likelihood around ages 29–30.
- Higher training intensity is associated with increased injury likelihood, though the effect size is modest.
- Recovery time alone does not strongly differentiate injured from non-injured athletes.
- Athletes with prior injuries show a slightly higher likelihood of future injury, but injury history alone is not a dominant predictor.

These findings suggest that injury risk is influenced by multiple interacting factors rather than a single variable.

## Real-World Application
The analytical approach used in this project mirrors injury prevention workflows in sports medicine and performance settings, where training load, recovery, and injury history are monitored collectively to inform risk management and return-to-play decisions.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
